Instead of pathcing the good old uploadr.py I am writing a new one based on python flickrapi.

The script creates a .flickr.set (contains a photosetid) and a .flickr.photos (contains filename => photo id mapping) files to every directory.
It uploads only the new photos from a directory based on this files. If necessery photoset is also created by the program.

It's just a simple script, isn't too complicated.

You can also install it with easy_install puploadr, and after that you can use puploadr command.
